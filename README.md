# Skin Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying skin cancer images into benign or malignant categories using deep learning. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and follows a structured approach for training, evaluation, and inference.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

### Steps
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Skin-Cancer-Classification.git
cd Skin-Cancer-Classification

# Create a virtual environment and activate it
python -m venv venv  # For Windows
tsource venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
This project uses a dataset of skin cancer images with a train-test split. Ensure the dataset is placed inside the `datasets/` directory.

## Training the Model
To train the model, run:
```sh
python src/train.py
```
The trained model will be saved in the `models/` directory.

## Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model using:
```sh
python src/main.py
```

## Running Inference
To test the model on new images, use:
```sh
python src/inference.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results & Visualization
- Training history plots (loss & accuracy)
- Sample predictions with confidence scores

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Data augmentation
- Deployment as a web API
